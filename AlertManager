# what is Alert Manager
- Alert Manager handles alerts fired by the promethus server
- Handles deduplication, grouping and routing of alerts
- Routes alerts to receivers(pager duty,email,slack)


##Alert Manager Concepts:
Grouping :- Groups similar Alerts into 1 notification
Inhibitaton : Silence other alerts if one specified alert is already fired.
             - site is down and if CPU is high
                there will be only one alert for site is dowm
Silence;- During the maintaince silence the 


Notes;-
Do not load balance this service,Instead use a list of alert manager in 
promethus config



Alert Manager port 
http://10.80.226.128:9093/



Alertstates:
----------
Inactive :- No rule is met
Pending:- Rule is met but can suppress due to validation
Firing - Alert is send to configured channel
